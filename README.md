Below are the steps to run and test:
1.  Please download or clone project.
2.  Open the exact folder sudokuValidator
3.  click validate.bat, it will open the command prompt with message "Enter file name [puzzleName.txt]:"
4. Without entering the file name, please press enter, It will take the default file from the root path
5. If you want to test any other file, then please put the file in the root of the project and enter the correct file name
6. If the sudoku is VALID than the output, you can check in the sudoku-Output.xlsx

Note: I have created 2 files for the testing (puzzleName.txt  and InvalidpuzzleName.txt)

Maven command:

mvn clean install
